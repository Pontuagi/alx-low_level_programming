C – DEBUGGING
Learning Objectives:
    • What is debugging
    • What are some methods of debugging manually
    • How to read the error messages

Files contained in this directory are:
    • 0-main.c, main.h - Based on the main.c file given, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
    • 1-main.c - Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. Don’t add or remove any lines of code. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
    • 2-largest_number.c, main.h - Fixed the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
    • 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. Fixed the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
